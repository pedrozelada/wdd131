            <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
            <p>Books play a fundamental role in the learning process, with each author presenting the same topics in diverse waysâ€”some in-depth, while others take a more summarized approach. Within books, a wide variety of exercises can be found, and explanations are often more detailed than in videos. This website aims to compile the best calculus books, providing a detailed review of each. Additionally, it will offer topic-specific recommendations for students interested in learning from these resources.</p>
